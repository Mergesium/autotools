## Building Notes

Describe what must be done for this project to configure and build correctly.
Example:
   After initial configuration, you must run `make update` once to fetch locale info. This bootstrap is only needed once.

## Testing Notes

Briefly describe what tests are available, and if they are automatically recognized by the extension, or what should be done to recognize them.

Example:
  - the `--enable-debug` flag must be added to `configureArgs` in order for unit tests to be built.
