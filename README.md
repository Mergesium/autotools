# [VSCode Autootools Integration](vscode://mergesium.autotools) knowledge base

This repo hosts the content published at the [knowledge base site](https://autotools.mergesium.com/kb)

The extension refers to pages in the knowledge base when it encounters various errors. The intention is to make it easy to find workarounds for various projects which use autotools, but have various quirks. Some common quirks are:
 * homegrown test suites (instead of automake's built-in test suites)
 * manual bootstrapping requirements
 * missing/undeclared dependencies
 * bugs in the extension itself
